# SimpleAndroidMusicPlayer
Simple Android app to test the MediaPLayer library for implementation into another project. App simply plays and pauses a local RAW mp3 resource.

This is a test app to explore MediaPlayer methods and does not use AudioManager to manage audio focus. Do not use this for anything.
